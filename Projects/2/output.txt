Low-key, no pressure

Rose-colored boy
I hear you making all that noise
About the world you want to see
And oh, I'm so annoyed
'Cause I just killed off what was left of the optimist in me

Hearts are breaking
Wars are raging on
And I have taken my glasses off
You got me nervous
I'm right at the end of my rope
A half empty girl
Don't make me laugh, I'll choke

Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy

Low-key, no pressure
just hang with me and my weather

I want you to stop
Insisting that I'm not a lost cause
'Cause I've been throught a lot
Really all I've got is just to stay pissed off

Hearts are breaking

Leave me here a little bit longer
I think I wanna stay in the car
I don't want anybody seeing me cry now
You say 'we gotta look on the bright side'
I say 'well maybe if you wanna go blind'
You say my eyes are getting too dark now
Boy you ain't ever seen my mind

Just let me cry a little bit longer

Insisting that I'm not a lost cause
'Cause I've been throught a lot
Really all I've got is just to stay pissed off
If it's all right by you

Hearts are breaking

And I have taken my glasses off
You got me nervous
And you're turning it into a joke
A half empty girl
Don't make me laugh, I'll

Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey, man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy

Leave me here a little bit longer
I think I wanna stay in the car
I don't want anybody seeing me cry now
You say 'we gotta look on the bright side'
I say 'well maybe if you wanna go blind'
You say my eyes are getting too dark now
Boy you ain't ever seen my mind

Just let me cry a little bit longer

Hearts are breaking

You got me nervous
I'm right at the end of my rope
A half empty girl
Don't make me laugh, I'll choke

Rose-colored boy
I hear you making all that noise
About the world you want to see

I think I wanna stay in the car
I don't want anybody seeing me cry now
You say 'we gotta look on the bright side'

You say my eyes are getting too dark now
Boy you ain't ever seen my mind

About the world you want to see
And oh, I'm so annoyed
'Cause I just killed off what was left of the optimist in me

Hearts are breaking
Wars are raging on
And I have taken my glasses off
You got me nervous
I'm right at the end of my rope
A half empty girl
Don't make me laugh, I'll choke

Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy

Low-key, no pressure
just hang with me and my weather

I want you to stop
Insisting that I'm not a lost cause
'Cause I've been throught a lot
Really all I've got is just to stay pissed off
If it's all right by you

Hearts are breaking
Wars are raging on
And I have taken my glasses off
You got me nervous
And you're turning it into a joke
A half empty girl
Don't make me laugh, I'll

Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey, man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy

Leave me here a little bit longer
I think I wanna stay in the car
I don't want anybody seeing me cry now
You say 'we gotta look on the bright side'
I say 'well maybe if you wanna go blind'
You say my eyes are getting too dark now
Boy you ain't ever seen my mind

Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey, man, we all can't be like you
